# Customer-Segmentation-model
# ðŸ§  Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to segment customers based on behavioral and demographic attributes. The goal is to identify distinct groups within a dataset to improve business strategy, marketing focus, and customer experience.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Data preprocessing using **pandas** and **NumPy**
- Dimensionality reduction with **t-SNE**
- Clustering via **K-Means**
- Initial analysis using **Linear Regression** (for exploration)
- Data visualization with **seaborn**
- Model development using **scikit-learn**


## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset consists of customer attributes including:
- Education, Income, Maretial_Status, etc.
- Behavioral indicators (optional)

Note: Ensure to anonymize any sensitive data if applicable.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Overview

- **t-SNE** was used to reduce high-dimensional features for better visualization.
- **K-Means** was applied to identify customer clusters.
- **Regression Analysis** provided preliminary insights but was not used in final clustering.

## ðŸŽ¯ Results

- Discovered _N_ unique customer segments.
- Visualized clusters using 2D plots with t-SNE.
- Business recommendations based on customer groups (e.g. targeted offers, retention strategies).
